# Comparison of PAKE protocols for web authentication
This project aims to compare the performance of two Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols for web authentication. The first is OPAQUE which is provided by the [`@cloudflare/opaque-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/opaque-ts) TypeScript library. The second is Owl, a new PAKE protocol which this project aims to implement in TypeScript. An express.js app will be used to demonstrate the protocols.
